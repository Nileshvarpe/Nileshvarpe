- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nilesh 
- ðŸŒ± I have reached a place in my programming journey where I can google just about anything (question, error, how to's),
read answers from here and there, combine them, know what will work, and end up making things work after 2-3 hours of this. Am I ready to call myself a programmer?
